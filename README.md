# crytography_cybersecurity_ML 
## This project piece was done during my stint at a company
First point to note is that the datasets used are all fabricated as the real data are highly confidential 

[newmandate_acc.xlsx](https://github.com/cjy93/crytography_cybersecurity_ML/blob/master/newmandate_acc.xlsx),   
[newmandate.xlsx](https://github.com/cjy93/crytography_cybersecurity_ML/blob/master/newmandate.xlsx)  
[dummydata_renamed_updated.xlsx](https://github.com/cjy93/crytography_cybersecurity_ML/blob/master/dummydata_renamed_updated.xlsx)  

The output files are  
[task1n2_PL_R2_v2.xlsx](https://github.com/cjy93/crytography_cybersecurity_ML/blob/master/task1n2_PL_R2_v2.xlsx)  
[task3.xlsx](https://github.com/cjy93/crytography_cybersecurity_ML/blob/master/task3.xlsx)  

where task3 has the following mandates

If you read through the task1n2 codes, you will realise some parts we need to do some form of a "hashing" technique, where we want to find
a list of "account numbers" that matches to a group of people with certain credentials. This group of people and their credentials are displayed
in the form of a **dataframe**. To do this, we need to use techniques in hashing, where each row of a dataframe is sorted, then stringed together.  

This is a method in Machine learning and cryptography.
Task3 is just another task where they require me to add remarks column according to certain mandates in task3.xlsx, then count the number
of times each unique individual is in a list.  

Various forms of data cleaning is involved in Task 1 to 3.
Hope you find my codes useful! I also attemped to convert to exe but github didnt allow me to upload the big files.
